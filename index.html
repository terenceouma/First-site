      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am the Creative Director at SAMO Branding Agency and Founder and Commercial Director at DOROS. I also like to code whenever I can so that I can hone in that skill.
        I love soccer, crossfit and gaming especially FIFA</p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>

        <img class="finance-img" src="Images/briefcase.png" alt="flaticon-briefcase">
        <h3>I am finance guy.</h3>
        <p>I started loving finance in highschool after I won a accounting competition called FAACS after only studying during the 4 hour drive to the competition.
          Then I studied Finance for my undergraduate as well as my MBA at Palm Beach Atlantic which is in the best city in the world. After graduating, I left the US and came back to Kenya and got a job at L'Oreal and worked there for 2 and a half
          years until recently.</p>

        <img class="lacrosse-img" src="Images/weightlifting.png" alt="weightlifting-icon">
        <h3>I am an Athlete.</h3>
        <p>I have played sports my whole life from soccer, crossfit, track and lacrosse. I learned how to play soccer when I was super young as well as track. But I started Crossfit and lacrosse in college and love them both. They are super low key
          sports that are really fun.
          Fun fact: I am still in the top 10 of the fastest people in my <a href="https://www.athletic.net/trackandfield/SchoolRecords.aspx?SchoolID=15329">highschool</a> for both 100m as well as 4x100m run.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="gaming-img" src="Images/computer.png" alt="computer-icon">
        <h3>I am a gamer.</h3>
        <p>I always wanted to play videos games growing up but my mom wasnt too keen because of the warnings on the box. But eventually when I was around 13, I started gaming a lot mostly playing soccer games from winning eleven to pro evolution
          soccer
          but the game that out lasted them all is FIFA. I have played every edition until Fifa 21. I also played COD in highschool since I had a Korean roomate with a gaming computer. I tried to play Fortnite but the skill gap was to big so I left
          that to the OG's also
          since I am in Nairobi lag is huge so I play games at around 70-100 ping.</p>

        <img class="cooking-img" src="Images/saute.png" alt="cooking-icon">
        <h3>I am <span class="pro">almost</span> a chef.</h3>
        <p> I love cooking now, growing up our parents made use cook a lot which I didnt enjoy. Think about it play video games or cook, but now I appreciate it cause those are the same skills I am using right now to chef.
          I like to cook foods from all over the world: Italian, Kenyan, American, Indian but what I need to learn is Chinese, Japanese and Korean food. I will do that soon.</p>
